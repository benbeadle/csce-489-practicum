CSCE 489 Practicum: Google Charts
===================

Intro
==========
Google Charts is a simple API that allows you to not only visualize data on websites, but is extremely simple to use, and automatically provides an interactive environment that allows the user to do more than just view the presentation of data. At the time of this writing, there are 14 different ways (read: graphs) you can display your data. Not only that, but Google provides simple ways of retrieving the data you want displayed from a myriad of sources. There is even an [interactive playground](https://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/?type=visualization#pie_chart) Google provides for you to play around with the different types of charts and ways to manipulate the data.
